/*
 * Note1: Mutable --> You can modify the content after creation.
 * 
 * Note2: More efficient for operations that involve frequent changes to the string, 
 * as it avoids creating new strings every time.
 * 
 * Note3: When you're creating a string by combining different pieces of information or data, 
 * a string buffer is useful because you can easily add or modify parts without starting over.
 * 
 * Note4: If you need to perform edits on a string, like insertions, deletions, or reversals, 
 * a string buffer is more efficient than repeatedly modifying a regular string.
